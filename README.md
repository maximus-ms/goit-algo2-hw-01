## "Analysis of algorithms. Divide and Conquer strategy".

### Task 1. Finding the maximum and minimum elements in an array

Implement a function that finds the maximum and minimum elements in an array using the "divide and conquer" strategy.

#### Requirements:

 - The function takes an array of numbers of arbitrary length as input.
 - Recursion is used.
 - The function returns a tuple of values (minimum, maximum).
 - The algorithm complexity is O(n).


### Task 2. Finding the k-th smallest element

Implement an algorithm to find the k-th smallest element in an unsorted array using the `Quick Select` principle.

#### Requirements:
 - The function should accept an array of numbers and the number k.
 - A pivot element selection approach must be used.
 - The array does not need to be fully sorted.
 - The expected average complexity should be O(n).
